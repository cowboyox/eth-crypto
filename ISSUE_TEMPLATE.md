<!--
  # STOP: DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE!

  It is very unlikely that you want to create an issue.

  ## You have found a bug?
  -> Create a pull request where you tried to reproduce the problem or at least haven shown that you tried to do so.
     You can start by editing this file: https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto/blob/master/test/bug-template.test.js

  ## You have a feature request?
  -> Create a pull request that shows how the API would change or how the new feature could be used.

  ## You have a common question which cannot be solved with a PR
  -> Ask it at one of these places:
    - https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/
    - https://gitter.im/ethereum/web3.js

  ## Everything else will likely be autoclosed. The maintainers time is as same as valuable as yours. 
  You are also a developer! You can fix stuff by yourself.
